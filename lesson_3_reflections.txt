1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I think a remote repository would be very useful when I want to backup code and data, or when I'm on the go and I could work on the same project with different computer or when I'm working with other people who are actively making changes to the code.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling manually helps me keeping a smart track of what is shared online: if I pulled instantly, maybe some changes are not ready yet or someone is still working on some files; with manual pull I'm supposed to know exactly when to receive the new versions.
